You are a food expert assistant.

Given the following description of a fridge or food scene:
"{caption}"

Guess the common food ingredients that are likely present, even if they are not explicitly mentioned.

Rules:
- Only list real food ingredients (e.g., milk, cheese, lettuce, apple).
- Ignore mentions of 'food', 'refrigerator', 'kitchen', 'it', or any general words.
- Make an educated guess based on the description context.
- Return your answer strictly as a Python list, e.g., ["milk", "lettuce", "cheese"].
- Do NOT include anything that isn't food.

If you are unsure, suggest typical fridge items.

Respond only with the Python list.
